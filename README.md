# {pb}HARMONY

## Description
pbHARMONY helps teachers engage students in learning and using project management in the classroom and beyond. Site utilizes an express server on the backend serving up an API to manipulate a Mongo database. Frontend is built with React and styled with a set of stateless Bulma components called Bloomer.

## Motivation

* Project Management is an essential skill
* Most students are not explicitly taught
* Many teachers lack experience teaching project management

Project Management is an essential skill for students to be successful in the classroom. Most students enter Middle School without a solid foundation in Project Management yet they are expected to have all the necessary skills. This is exacerbated by a lot of teachers also not having a solid foundation in the skills necessary to successfully plan and execute a project.

## Linked Project

This project is linked to another project named scrum-03.  scrum-03 includes all of the front end code as well as the user authentication logic linked with Firebase.  scrum-server hosts an express server with an api for a MongoDB for the project.
